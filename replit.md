2. Product data stored in PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
3. Public product pages fetch data through API endpoints
4. Product filtering and search implemented client-side

### Quote Generation
1. Customer submits quote request through public form
2. Quote data stored with "pending" status
3. Admin reviews and updates quotes through admin dashboard
4. PDF generation available for completed quotes
